[person_name]
[first_name] if you are reading this it means that I am not with you. What I wrote here was sprinkled with tears of my despair. Remember on February 28 we got married, it was the most beautiful day of my life, every day after that was better.
I remember well how I came for the first time, you let me kiss you after which I knew that we would be together. I came to pick you up in the morning to walk you to the bus. I was with you for only 20 minutes but I felt happy. You gave me a new life, you gave me joy and happiness I tried my best to give you the same, maybe I succeeded, maybe not. Every day with you was a holiday for me, every touch or kiss from you made me feel like I was in heaven. You called me [add_name] and I called you [first_name] [first_name] I love you with all my heart you are my life and never forget that no matter what happens. Apologize to everyone on my behalf. Your parents for not being able to give happiness to their daughter, my mother and uncle thank them for everything I have received from them and apologize that I will not be riding the carousels next year. [First_name] and [first_name] apologize that we didn't find a common language even though everyone tried. [First_name] and [first_name] apologize that I won't come to the communion. To your mother, thank her for the delicious jellies, stew and bigos, to your father for treating me like a real son-in-law, and let him sometimes drink Tatra to my health. To my father, tell him thank you for the destroyed childhood and for always treating me like a parasite. He will be better off now. You were very good to me, with you I looked like a man well-dressed I felt valued. Now I'm gone. Remember how you said that when we move out we will take everything so do [person_name]. What I am writing hurts me a lot I never thought I would have to write this. I love you I will always love you and I want you to remember that. I'm sorry I had to do this but I don't want to hurt you I never wanted to I want you to know that. Last time I asked you if I died would you put your life back together. Now this is my request. Be happy with someone else but don't ever forget me, the crazy man who loved you as much as he could and always will. I want to see you make a new life for yourself as you give birth to children as you raise them I have a request if you had a son give him my name just as a memory of me. I want to see you enjoy life but sometimes mention me even if in jest but mention me. I love you I love you I love you I love you I am sorry that what I did caused you pain and despair but after time you will come to the conclusion that it was for the best. I have always maintained that I don't want to hurt anyone and that is why I did what I did. Know this that I will look down on you and I want you to be happy so that someone will love you at least half as much as I do. I remember the first time we danced together it was wonderful. I won't forget how you wanted a number from [first_name] to run an errand with me. I was happy that you were not indifferent to me. I vowed love and fidelity to you and I kept my vow. Please mention me sometimes in conversation with my parents. Please visit my mother. You know they loved you like their own daughter. 
I am crying like a baby as I write this apologize to all [first_name], [first_name], [first_name], [first_name], [add_name], [first_name], [first_name], [first_name], [first_name], let them not think badly of me.
Please in my coffin put our wedding photo, my Real Madrid scarf, I remember when we were in Bremen And we went for walks, apologize to my aunt uncle, [first_name], [add_name], [add_name], [add_name] and [add_name] from my mother. Give my mother a hug on my behalf. Thank her for everything. Tell my uncle to take care of his diabetes. Oh and put Mascot [first_name] in my coffin to be with me. I love you.
All my life I have been waiting for a person like you, for such happiness I finally managed to get all in one. It is a pity that my happiness was so short-lived Thank you for everything I had and what I could have for everything I thank you.
For the wonderful smile, for the sweet kiss, for the wonderful nights and you remember how we combined that you go to watch the kid, as we drove to Vistula, every moment with you is an eternity for me.
Thus I end these few words.
I love you and never forget it. Remember me sometimes, and preferably once a month bring a white rose to my grave I will know that you have not forgotten me.

I LOVE YOU- SORRY
I'M SORRY
I love you MOST WILL LOVE YOU EVEN IN THE SECOND WORLD.
I WANT TO SEE HOW YOU ARE enjoying life HOW YOU ARE raising your children HOW YOU ARE growing old.
I'M SORRY I DID IT BUT IT WAS FOR THE BEST.

Statement
All that I have together with my wife [first_name].
[last_name] I give exclusively to her.


[first_name] [last_name].
We are just sitting in the kitchen talking about the future (for you and me). I know that we will split up, each will try to make a new life for himself. It is known that children keep us in a permanent relationship. Because we are their parents. I think you ([add_name]) will find a guy worthy of you, because you are a great mother and wife. Your only first guy couldn't understand that.

I write ([person_name]) so because I know that I was difficult for and first you. For this I am very sorry to you and I regret my behavior. Surely you will love a man and live together.

Only the ups and downs will start again. You will think back to our (unfinished) marriage. I know that I would also like to arrange a new life to be happy. Only I know that I will have one or another woman and maybe another, etc. because I will want to find the same ideal as you are and I know that this is
impossible. I believe that life will bring us together again after some time. Even when we are very old, because we are made for each other.

Your loving husband
[first_name]

I am writing to you because I am not getting along. I can't find a place I don't see the point of working and I can't work or sleep. I'm trying to be strong, but it's not working out for me. After all, I wanted to do well all the time, I tried to make you and the children have everything. Maybe I was difficult to live with, but I didn't have it easy myself either. To my justification take the fact that all the time I was thinking about you.

One job, another and another, and what does fate give me in return? What should I do - to get you? Now life is giving me a hard time and I can't accept it.
I can't imagine life without you and the children.

Tell me - what should I do to make you want to be with me. You don't want to see me - that's what you said - so I can't come, but all the time I'm waiting for such an opportunity Never in my life - I didn't expect such words from you, that's why it's such a blow to me, - unlivable. I could expect everything, but not what happened to me. I worked all the time to make you well. There are different moments in life, but such a shot, after so many years - something you could not even think about. Did you pretend all these years - I was very happy.

You said a lot of words to me, I said a lot too - but I keep explaining to myself that this is just a nightmare dream from which I will wake up tomorrow. Always remember that I am in love with you (from this) - unhappily in love and the children need a mom and dad - they are still small and I worked and work for you. It is hard to come to terms with the fact that the woman you love wants another man and despises the former love or does not value the effort made for her - but I will put up with everything as long as you are well. I remain in Wroclaw so that I can collect my thoughts and fulfill your wish but all the time I am waiting for a signal from you so that I can come home. 

You've shattered me so that I'm not myself, I'm brandishing myself in front of people, but I don't know how long I can manage. I'm afraid of the future and what might happen. I don't know anything, but I agree to everything, as long as you are mine and can love me once again.
Your loving husband'''
apology6 = '''[first_name] sorry
But I had no other choice. I am sober and sane. This is my will, you will send the death certificate the address is in an envelope preferably priority so that she has before Christmas.

I will take from Social Security money about (5300) You will bury me without a mass and without a priest., no wreath no flowers, do not post an hourglass on the gate. Take the cheapest coffin, so that as much as possible is left, you will give [first_name] PLN 15. What is left you will deduct yourself for the trouble, nicoiem andk leave the rest you will send again to Her address. From Social Security rebuke in 18 days of December you will get. Best not to go to the funeral just been alone and let it stay that way w/w

I will leave a letter to her let no one read it and you will send it the same day or tomorrow morning.

P.S.. 
Ask them not to read it or hide it and send it on Monday because post offices don't work on Saturdays THIS addressed envelope also with death certificate to [first_name] [last_name]. 

Goodbye and sorry for the inconvenience'''

YES I LOVE 

And from the hospital they threw me out because I am an unruly child'''
apology8 = '''The last you saw of us alive. [first_name] had days numbered, we decided to escape from the pain and suffering because I myself experienced it early on my own skin and I know what a torture it is to exist and not live. Regret that fate has so directed life I loved you very much and the lack of the fact that I did not teach you to ride a bike, swim we never played ball together but it was not meant for us. Help [first_name] and [first_name] arrange our last journey and have good thoughts about me.

Farewell 

The signet ring is an inheritance for you from your father.

Forgive us this step, but I was forced to take my aunt home because they wanted to transport her to Bedzin, at discharge the orderly himself said to my aunt and me that there was no possibility of any treatment and was left waiting to go down. My aunt did not want to relive the pain, suffering and final agony and I, not seeing further existence without her, decided we would take this step. We loved you all equally so we have a request to all of you to cremate us and have one funeral together, the company on which the letters lie will take care of this comprehensively. There are money and PZU policies to collect from the company, the hourglass will also be hung there.

The money from the aunt's PZU policy will be for [first_name] for which she should pay the rent for the apartment, I would ask you to see to it that [first_name] does not fritter it away. Let the money from my PZU policy go to [first_name], who last saw us alive. Here on the table we leave all the funds we have at our disposal so divide them evenly among you. Of the material things what you will think may be usable also divide among yourselves. In my phone in the phone book there are people you can notify of our death, my aunt [first_name] my sister and your godmother notify you after some time so that she doesn't make you some kind of row because knowing her character everything can be expected With the car do as you wish and the funds for it also divide, the key to the basement lies on the table in which there are winter wheels and a bicycle [first_name].

In the room there is a gas stove older than what hangs in the bathroom then you can replace it, and take the new one for yourself or for [first_name].

Me not wanting to be a burden to you, because without my aunt I would be like a car without an engine, in which our life she played its role. Forgive and farewell and keep us in good memories.
Farewell

[First_name] there is spirit in the bar it is for you to inherit. Let's let totolots check because there may be a win.

[First_name] cancel at the newsstand leaving newspapers do away with the Web scraping set up there. Take your mom's Nokia phone and you can give mine to [first_name] as an inheritance, in 13 days the time for recharging ends, then there are cards here then recharge them

You will be left alone with [first_name] without us, mom did not want to relive the pain and suffering, and I could not see continuing life without her. We loved you very much and helped you as much as we could, maybe you will understand what life is and maybe the resources you will get from us will help you bounce back and get back on your feet, and don't be ashamed to take advice from [first_name], [first_name], or [first_name] because they will only be the closest family to you now. Don't break down, try to live and raise [first_name] the way we raised you have a good memory of us and light a candle over the grave from time to time and reflect that we always wanted good things for you and your child.

Farewell'''
apology9 = '''I apologize to everyone for what I did. [First_name] forgive me please. I love you very much. No one is to blame for what happened.

I simply outgrew it all. I can't take this kind of life anymore, treating me like someone who doesn't exist. 

I love you [first_name] - [person_name].

I'm sorry.
Forgive me

It is possible that as you read this letter now you are crying but it happens. What I did was my decision. I decided that life without you doesn't make sense. I thought I was too good for you and this world. I wished I had been a thief and the worst because maybe then we would have been together. I loved you until the last minute 
It was your goodbye that put me out even more. I don't know what made you make such a move 
For the seven months that I was with you I loved you all the time. 

I'll say one thing it's out of love for you Goodbye Bye Bye
